Every day, new features will be added to the application, and we'll take advantage of this development to introduce you to new BackBee functionalities as well as good practices in web development.\n\n\nThis tutorial is also inspired by the \nso famous Jobeet\n, the book to learn \nsymfony 1\n which describes how to build a business jobs application.\n\n\nWhat for today?\n\n\nThe objective of this day is to setup the environment and install the CMS. At the end of the day we expect to see the \"Hello world\" from BackBee.\n\n\nWe assume you have basic knowledge of PHP5, Apache or Nginx and MySQL.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nBefore installing BackBee, you need to check you have everything installed and configured correctly. You should really care about this first day and follow all the steps required to check your configuration, this may easy your days further down the road.\n\n\nThird party Software\n\n\nFirst of all, you need to check that your computer has a friendly working environment for web development. At a minimum, you need a web server (Apache, for instance), a database engine (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or any PDO-compatible database engine), and \nPHP 5.4\n or later.\n\n\nAt least, you need to install \ngit\n.\n\n\nAlso, you will need to install \nComposer\n the dependency manager for PHP.\n\n\nFollow this link to install it if your are on \nLinux/Unix based OS\n (like ubuntu or Mac OS X), Composer is also available on \nWindows system\n.\n\n\nIn a command line interface, check if \ncomposer\n is correctly installed:\n\n\n\n\nAlso, check your PHP version which should be 5.4 or greater.\n\n\n\n\nEventually, you need to set up a domain name in your operating system.\nOn Unix/Linux based OS, you can add it into \n/etc/hosts\n file, we will choose \nblogbee.dev\n:\n\n\n127.0.0.1   blogbee.dev\n\n\n\nPHP extensions and configuration\n\n\nYou need to activate \nmbstring\n, \npdo_mysql\n and \npdo_sqlite\n extensions.\nThen you also need to set a correct date.timezone in your \nphp.ini\n configuration file:\n\n\n[Date]\ndate.timezone=Europe/Paris\n\n\n\nOk ! We can now launch the installation process.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nOpen a command line interface and get BackBee:\n\n\n$ composer create-project \"backbee/backbee-standard\" /path/to/your/folder \"1.0\" -n\n\n\n\nThen on the \npublic\n directory, launch the builtin server of PHP:\n\n\n$ cd /path/to/your/folder/public \n php -S blogbee.dev:8000\n\n\n\nAnd you should see the first installation step of BackBee (access \nhttp://localhost:8000/install.php\n) in a web browser:\n\n\n\n\nYou need to create \ncache\n and \nlog\n folders with the correct rights, then you can refresh the page and access to the \nsecond step\n of the installer.\n\n\n\n\nIf required, check the \nrepository/Config\n folder rights and then proceed with the \nthird\n step.\n\n\nYou need to set your database settings. If you use a different database engine than MySQL or MariaDB, set the correct driver else you have nothing to change, only fill the fields \ndatabase name\n, \nusername\n and \npassword\n.\n\n\n\n\nYou also need to define your super admin user, fill the credentials then save and continue to the \nfourth\n step.\n\n\n\n\nBackBee Installer creates and populates the database, fill the last information to complete the installation process: the \nsite_name\n and the \ndomain\n.\n\n\n\n\nYou are done: BackBee gives you the \nApache\n or \nNginx\n configuration you have to set to be able to use BackBee on the chosen domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have set your web server, access the site by going to \nhttp://blogbee.dev\n.\n\n\nIf everything is correctly installed, you should see the BackBee welcome message:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can't see BackBee welcome message, check both \ncache\n and \nlog\n folders have the correct rights.\n\n\n\n\nYou can even connect to the \"Edition mode\", press  \nCTRL + ALT + B\n to show the login dialog. Note that we created a super admin user for you with login (=admin) and password (=admin).\n\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts\n\n\nWell, time is over! Even if we have not yet started talking about BackBee, we did setup a solid development environment and we are ready to start coding.\n\n\nTomorrow, we will unveil what the application will do and talk about the requirements we need to implement for \nBlogBee\n.",

If architecture is a bit complex to understand, you will see that it is subsequently very easy to quickly build any type of website.\n\n\nWhat for today?\n\n\nToday we will learn how BackBee manages content. This will be a somewhat difficult day and we recommend you to reread this tutorial to understand the system. By late afternoon, you will understand how to integrate the templates that we built in the second day and how to create the layouts for our pages.\n\n\nThe \"big picture\"\n\n\nLet's start with a schema which represent the BackBee architecture of our \nArticle page\n:\n\n\n\n\nEach element have its object representation inside \nBackBee core library\n:\n\n\n\n\nSite\n (\nBackBuilder\\Site\\Site\n) is your application.\n\n\nPage\n (\nBackBuilder\\NestedNode\\Page\n) represents each page of your application, for example for blogbee we have three pages: home page, article page and author page.\n\n\nLayout\n (\nBackBuilder\\Site\\Layout\n) represents the layout of a page.\n\n\nContentSet\n (\nBackBuilder\\ClassContent\\ContentSet\n) represents the blocs/columns of your layouts, there are blocks that can be editable by the user.\n\n\n\n\nWe will create the complete structure of our pages and go further on \nDay 4\n, for now let's create our layouts.\n\n\nLayout creation process\n\n\nIt's time to work!\n\n\nIn our website we will have static and dynamic content as you can see in this detailed mockup:\n\n\n\n\nWe need to create two layouts:\n\n\n\n\nA \"one-column\" layout for author related pages\n\n\nA \"two-columns\" layout for home and article pages\n\n\n\n\nCreation of layouts\n\n\nConnect to BackBee (Remember, \nCTRL + ALT + B\n then fill your credentials) and select \nTemplates\n tab on top of the editor.\n\n\nBackBee embeds a lot of common layouts and the layouts we need are already provided by the CMS.\n\n\n\n\nClick on \"Other templates\", and select \"Default template\" which is only composed of one single column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the Template name and set it to \nOneColumn\n and do the same for a \"two columns\" layout that we will name \"TwoLayouts\".\n\n\n\n\nYou will see two files generated inside \nrepository/Layouts\n :  \nOneColumn.twig\n and \nTwoColumns.twig\n, where we will insert our previous Bootstrap 3 templates from \nDay 2\n, and the calls to BackBee.\n\n\nWe have used \nTwig\n as templating engine, in order to extend via \ntemplate inheritance\n, but BackBee also supports old simple \nphtml\n templating engine.\n\n\nThen, add a \nMain.twig\n file in the \nrepository\\Layout\n folder which will act as a parent of each layout.\n\n\nIntegration of our layouts\n\n\nMain.twig\n is the parent template with all static parts of the website and blocks we will extend in \nArticle.twig\n and \nAuthor.twig\n templates\n\n\n!DOCTYPE html\n\n\n\nhtml\n\n    \nhead lang=\nen\n\n        \nmeta charset=\nutf-8\n/meta\n\n        \ntitle\nBlogBee -

As a user manipulates contents through the toolbar, we will do the link between our files and configurations and the toolbar features activated and displayed. This way, you will understand how to provide features to your final users.\n\n\nWhat for today?\n\n\nIn \nDay 4\n, we added an Article content and this is great but you still can't edit it.\nToday, we will also discover the different \"modes\" of the toolbar and then we will complete our configuration files in order to allow our final users to create and edit articles.\n\n\nBackBee Edition mode\n\n\nthe \"big picture\"\n\n\nThe first time you connect into \nEdition mode\n you may be a bit lost due to multiple buttons and tabs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe \nLanguage Selector\n: the Edition mode is available in english and in french.\n\n\nthe \nStateManager\n: to save, apply or cancel the modifications done to your content.\n\n\nthe \nMode Selector\n:  this allows to switch between modes of the BackBee editor.\n\n\nonly in Edit mode\n:  the \nPanel Selector\n to choose which kind of content to edit.\n\n\n\n\nthe \nTemplates\n mode\n\n\nWe already have used the \nTemplate editor\n before to create our layouts.\n\n\n\n\nAll the templates stored in \nrepository/Layouts\n folder appear in the left side.\nYou can select and edit them with the available options, all templates are based on a \ngrid system\n like in the front-end framework \nBootstrap\n.\n\n\nEach time you create a template, a file \ntemplateName\n.twig\n is created in \nrepository/Layouts\n folder.\nIn previous versions of BackBee CMS, any user can drag the column size but this feature is now deprecated and will be removed in the \n1.0 release\n.\n\n\nthe \nEdit\n mode\n\n\nWhen you login to BackBee Edition mode, you start in \nEdit mode\n:\n\n\n\n\nThis mode is contextual and strongly depends on what content is selected.\n\n\nthe \nPage\n panel\n\n\nthe \nPage\n panel is obviously used to manage pages, from hierarchy to SEO properties.\n\n\n\n\nYou can change the status of a page: if set to offline, non logged users can't access it. You can also schedule it to publish and archive it.\n\n\nAlso, if you click on the \"Sitemap\" link you access the page tree we have introduced on \nDay 3\n, and can easily reorganize page order and hierarchy.\n\n\nFor example, let's create a page.\nClick on \"New page\" and fill the form with \"article\" as title and \"Article\" as Template. \nYou can either do this by creating it right-clicking on Home page or using the Tools drop-down menu.\n\nThen, click on Save button and take a look at the \"Sitemap widget\".\n\n\n\n\nThe article page is offline, has a red hatched logo, an online page (like the \nroot\n Home page) is white. You can manage your pages through the widget and/or in the \nPage\n panel.\n\n\nthe \nBoxes\n panel\n\n\nYou will probably only use this panel when you build your website.\nDouble-click on \"article\" in the \"Sitemap widget\" to access the new page created. Then switch to the \nBoxes\n panel:\n\n\n\n\nAnd you retrieve the blocks created in the \nrepository\\ClassContent\\article.yml\n file.\n\n\nFor example, click on the \"Upload picture\":\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nbreadcrumb\n, you can see \nContentSet \n article \n Media\\image\n.\nIf you take a look at your yaml file, you can see that an image has an image element, which is a \nBackBuilder\\ClassContent\\Media\\image\n class: good.\n\n\nYou can see also that Boxes are organized by \ncategory\n. If you click on \nArticle\n category you will find all the contents we created on \nDay 4\n with the category \"Article\": this is how BackBee orders and allows content to be used.\n\n\nEach content must have a category, but sometimes you may need to deactivate a content because the final user shouldn't manipulate it.\n\n\nYou can use the \"!\" operator to filter contents, for instance we don't want the final user to add other article bodies to an article.\n\n\n# /repository/ClassContent/Article/Body.yml\nbody:\n  extends: \\BackBuilder\\ClassContent\\ContentSet\n  properties:\n    category: [!Article]\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, \nbody\n is not part of available contents.\n\n\nthe \nContent\n panel\n\n\nThis is the more used panel of BackBee, able to manipulable all editable blocks.\n\n\n\n\nYou may wonder how to make a block editable. Usually, this is a problem solved\nby configuration via yaml.\n\n\nLet's assume you want to let users edit the title of an article:\n\n\narticle:\n    properties:\n        name: Article\n        description: \"An article contains title, abstract, main image and a customizable body\"\n        category: [article]\n    elements:\n        title:\n            type: BackBuilder\\ClassContent\\Element\\text\n            parameters:\n                aloha: !!scalar lite\n                editable: !!boolean true\n\n\n\nAs you can see, we have added some \nparameters\n to the article title configuration. Each parameter has a type and a value.\n\n\n\n\naloha\n:  \"lite\" is a configuration tree key in ``/repository/Config/rteconfig.yml, we will talk about aloha configuration later\n\n\neditable\n: this is explicit, we are now allowed to edit the title\n\n\n\n\nRefresh your browser page and click on your article title, which is now editable.\n\n\n\n\nthe \nBundles\n mode\n\n\nIn BackBee, \nBundles\n are mostly considered \"plugins\".

You can change the status of a page: if set to offline, non logged users can't access it. You can also schedule it to publish and archive it.  Also, if you click on the \"Sitemap\" link you access the page tree we have introduced on  Day 3 , and can easily reorganize page order and hierarchy.  For example, let's create a page.\nClick on \"New page\" and fill the form with \"article\" as title and \"Article\" as Template.  You can either do this by creating it right-clicking on Home page or using the Tools drop-down menu. \nThen, click on Save button and take a look at the \"Sitemap widget\".   The article page is offline, has a red hatched logo, an online page (like the  root  Home page) is white. You can manage your pages through the widget and/or in the  Page  panel.  the  Boxes  panel  You will probably only use this panel when you build your website.\nDouble-click on \"article\" in the \"Sitemap widget\" to access the new page created. Then switch to the  Boxes  panel:   And you retrieve the blocks created in the  repository\\ClassContent\\article.yml  file.  For example, click on the \"Upload picture\":   In the  breadcrumb , you can see  ContentSet   article   Media\\image .\nIf you take a look at your yaml file, you can see that an image has an image element, which is a  BackBuilder\\ClassContent\\Media\\image  class: good.  You can see also that Boxes are organized by  category . If you click on  Article  category you will find all the contents we created on  Day 4  with the category \"Article\": this is how BackBee orders and allows content to be used.  Each content must have a category, but sometimes you may need to deactivate a content because the final user shouldn't manipulate it.  You can use the \"!\" operator to filter contents, for instance we don't want the final user to add other article bodies to an article.  # /repository/ClassContent/Article/Body.yml\nbody:\n  extends: \\BackBuilder\\ClassContent\\ContentSet\n  properties:\n    category: [!Article]  And now,  body  is not part of available contents.  the  Content  panel  This is the more used panel of BackBee, able to manipulable all editable blocks.   You may wonder how to make a block editable. Usually, this is a problem solved\nby configuration via yaml.  Let's assume you want to let users edit the title of an article:  article:\n    properties:\n        name: Article\n        description: \"An article contains title, abstract, main image and a customizable body\"\n        category: [article]\n    elements:\n        title:\n            type: BackBuilder\\ClassContent\\Element\\text\n            parameters:\n                aloha: !!scalar lite\n                editable: !!boolean true  As you can see, we have added some  parameters  to the article title configuration. Each parameter has a type and a value.   aloha :  \"lite\" is a configuration tree key in ``/repository/Config/rteconfig.yml, we will talk about aloha configuration later  editable : this is explicit, we are now allowed to edit the title   Refresh your browser page and click on your article title, which is now editable.",

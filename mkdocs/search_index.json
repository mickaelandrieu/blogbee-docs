Every day, new features will be added to the application, and we'll take advantage of this development to introduce you to new BackBee functionalities as well as good practices in web development.\n\n\nThis tutorial is also inspired by the \nso famous Jobeet\n, the book to learn \nsymfony 1\n which describes how to build a business jobs application.\n\n\nWhat for today?\n\n\nThe objective of this day is to setup the environment and install the CMS. At the end of the day we expect to see the \"Hello world\" from BackBee.\n\n\nWe assume you have basic knowledge of PHP5, Apache or Nginx and MySQL.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nBefore installing BackBee, you need to check you have everything installed and configured correctly. You should really care about this first day and follow all the steps required to check your configuration, this may easy your days further down the road.\n\n\nThird party Software\n\n\nFirst of all, you need to check that your computer has a friendly working environment for web development. At a minimum, you need a web server (Apache, for instance), a database engine (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or any PDO-compatible database engine), and \nPHP 5.4\n or later.\n\n\nAt least, you need to install \ngit\n.\n\n\nAlso, you will need to install \nComposer\n the dependency manager for PHP.\n\n\nFollow this link to install it if your are on \nLinux/Unix based OS\n (like ubuntu or Mac OS X), Composer is also available on \nWindows system\n.\n\n\nIn a command line interface, check if \ncomposer\n is correctly installed:\n\n\n\n\nAlso, check your PHP version which should be 5.4 or greater.\n\n\n\n\nEventually, you need to set up a domain name in your operating system.\nOn Unix/Linux based OS, you can add it into \n/etc/hosts\n file, we will choose \nblogbee.dev\n:\n\n\n127.0.0.1   blogbee.dev\n\n\n\nPHP extensions and configuration\n\n\nYou need to activate \nmbstring\n, \npdo_mysql\n and \npdo_sqlite\n extensions.\nThen you also need to set a correct date.timezone in your \nphp.ini\n configuration file:\n\n\n[Date]\ndate.timezone=Europe/Paris\n\n\n\nOk ! We can now launch the installation process.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nOpen a command line interface and get BackBee:\n\n\n$ composer create-project \"backbee/backbee-standard\" /path/to/your/folder \"1.0\" -n\n\n\n\nThen on the \npublic\n directory, launch the builtin server of PHP:\n\n\n$ cd /path/to/your/folder/public \n php -S blogbee.dev:8000\n\n\n\nAnd you should see the first installation step of BackBee (access \nhttp://localhost:8000/install.php\n) in a web browser:\n\n\n\n\nYou need to create \ncache\n and \nlog\n folders with the correct rights, then you can refresh the page and access to the \nsecond step\n of the installer.\n\n\n\n\nIf required, check the \nrepository/Config\n folder rights and then proceed with the \nthird\n step.\n\n\nYou need to set your database settings. If you use a different database engine than MySQL or MariaDB, set the correct driver else you have nothing to change, only fill the fields \ndatabase name\n, \nusername\n and \npassword\n.\n\n\n\n\nYou also need to define your super admin user, fill the credentials then save and continue to the \nfourth\n step.\n\n\n\n\nBackBee Installer creates and populates the database, fill the last information to complete the installation process: the \nsite_name\n and the \ndomain\n.\n\n\n\n\nYou are done: BackBee gives you the \nApache\n or \nNginx\n configuration you have to set to be able to use BackBee on the chosen domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you have set your web server, access the site by going to \nhttp://blogbee.dev\n.\n\n\nIf everything is correctly installed, you should see the BackBee welcome message:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can't see BackBee welcome message, check both \ncache\n and \nlog\n folders have the correct rights.\n\n\n\n\nYou can even connect to the \"Edition mode\", press  \nCTRL + ALT + B\n to show the login dialog. Note that we created a super admin user for you with login (=admin) and password (=admin).\n\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts\n\n\nWell, time is over! Even if we have not yet started talking about BackBee, we did setup a solid development environment and we are ready to start coding.\n\n\nTomorrow, we will unveil what the application will do and talk about the requirements we need to implement for \nBlogBee\n.",

The PHP Content Repository is an adaptation of the Java Content Repository ( JCR ) standard, an open API specification defined in  JSR-283 .\nThe API defines how to handle hierarchical semi-structured data in a consistent way.  The typical use case is content management systems. PHPCR combines the best of document-oriented databases (weak structured data) and of XML databases (hierarchical trees). On top of that, it adds useful features like searching, versioning, access control and locking on top of it.  BackBee Content Management System  follows most of the  PHP Content Repository  recommendations.  If you want to learn more about the PHPCR, you can read the  online documentation  or take a look at this  lecture from one of the PHPCR contributors  which provides a good understanding of the whole system.  BackBee Content Management System  BackBee Content Management System provides the following features:   Access hierarchical tree  Access by UUID  Node search  Versioning  XML import   export  Secured Access   Site   Pages  A website can have multiple pages, and a page can have a parent page and a collection of \"children\" pages, ordered by \"level\" in the tree.  A page can have a parent (if not, the page is considered as a \"root page\"):   Layout  We have seen on  Day 3  the layouts, each page has a layout and all the contents are linked to the layout.\nThe reality is a little bit complex, because a page has a ContentSet (this is a special Content type: for now let's say this is an ordered collection of Content) which contains all the contents of the page.  When we need to render a web page, the  Renderer :   Checks if the Page ContentSet is not  null  Gets all the zones of the Page layout (1 column, 2 columns like the layouts defined on  Day 3 )  Loops on the contents of the ContentSet and  puts the content  on the correct column (or \"zone\")   To conclude,  Layout  is used by the  Renderer  to put the correct content on the zones defined in the layout.  Content Element  A content element is a very simple yaml file, which has  properties  and  elements .\nFor instance, this is the actual representation a  text  element:  # BackBuilder\\ClassContent\\Element\\text.yml\ntext:\n  properties:\n    name: Text\n    description: A simple text input\n  elements:\n    value: !!scalar  A content element is not selectable in BackBee out of the box, in order to use it\nyou need to embed it into a Content.

As a user manipulates contents through the toolbar, we will do the link between our files and configurations and the toolbar features activated and displayed. This way, you will understand how to provide features to your final users.\n\n\nWhat for today?\n\n\nIn \nDay 3\n, we added an Article content and this is great but you still can't edit it.\nToday, we will also discover the different \"modes\" of the toolbar and then we will complete our configuration files in order to allow our final users to create and edit articles.\n\n\nBackBee Edition mode\n\n\nDiscover the \"toolbar\"\n\n\nThe first time you connect into \nEdition mode\n you may be a bit lost due to multiple buttons and tabs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe \nUser settings selector\n: to access settings and disconnect from Edition mode.\n\n\nthe \nState manager selector\n: to save, apply or cancel the modifications done to your contents.\n\n\nthe \nMode selector\n:  this allows to switch between modes of the BackBee editor.\n\n\nonly in Edit mode\n:  the \nPanel selector\n to choose which kind of content to edit.\n\n\n\n\nthe \nUser management\n mode\n\n\nAccess the User management panel to access users and groups:\n\n\n\n\nYou can search for an user with the search form, manage an user, create new ones, or add them to a group.\n\n\nWhat is an user group ?\n\n\nIn BackBee the authorisations can be very precises and specifics.\nOut of box, we provide three groups with the following rights on contents:\n\n\n\n\nAdministrators\n: users of this group have all rights on the website and its features;\n\n\nValidators\n: users of this group can create, edit and publish;\n\n\nContributors\n: users of this group can only create and edit but not publish. \n\n\n\n\nthe \nEdit\n mode\n\n\nWhen you login to BackBee Edition mode, you start in \nEdit mode\n:\n\n\n\n\nThis mode is contextual and strongly depends on what content is selected.\n\n\nthe \nPage\n panel\n\n\nthe \nPage\n panel is obviously used to manage pages, from hierarchy to SEO properties.\n\n\n\n\nYou can change the status of a page: if set to offline, non logged users can't access it. You can also schedule it to publish and archive it.\n\n\nAlso, if you click on the \"Sitemap\" link you access the page tree we have introduced on \nDay 3\n, and can easily reorganize page order and hierarchy.\n\n\nFor example, let's create a page.\nClick on \"New page\" and fill the form with \"article\" as title and \"Article\" as Template. \nYou can either do this by creating it right-clicking on Home page or using the Tools drop-down menu.\n\nThen, click on Save button and take a look at the \"Sitemap widget\".\n\n\n\n\nThe article page is offline, has a red hatched logo, an online page (like the \nroot\n Home page) is white. You can manage your pages through the widget and/or in the \nPage\n panel.\n\n\nthe \nBoxes\n panel\n\n\nYou will probably only use this panel when you build your website.\nDouble-click on \"article\" in the \"Sitemap widget\" to access the new page created. Then switch to the \nBoxes\n panel:\n\n\n\n\nAnd you retrieve the blocks created in the \nrepository\\ClassContent\\article.yml\n file.\n\n\nFor example, click on the \"Upload picture\":\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nbreadcrumb\n, you can see \nContentSet \n article \n Media image\n.\nIf you take a look at your yaml file, you can see that an image has an image element, which is a \nBackBee\\ClassContent\\Media\\image\n class: good.\n\n\nYou can see also that Boxes are organized by \ncategory\n. If you click on \nArticle\n category you will find all the contents we created on \nDay 4\n with the category \"Article\": this is how BackBee orders and allows content to be used.\n\n\nEach content must have a category, but sometimes you may need to deactivate a content because the final user shouldn't manipulate it.\n\n\nYou can use the \"!\" operator to filter contents, for instance we don't want the final user to add other article bodies to an article.\n\n\n# /repository/ClassContent/Article/Body.yml\nbody:\n  extends: \\BackBee\\ClassContent\\ContentSet\n  properties:\n    category: [!Article]\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, \nbody\n is not part of available contents.\n\n\nthe \nContent\n panel\n\n\nThis is the most used panel of BackBee, able to manipulable all editable blocks. You may wonder how to make a block editable. Usually, this is a problem solved by Yaml configuration of the block.\n\n\nLet's assume you want to let users edit the title of an article:\n\n\narticle:\n    properties:\n        name: Article\n        description: \"An article contains title, abstract, main image and a customizable body\"\n        category: [article]\n    elements:\n        title:\n            type: BackBee\\ClassContent\\Element\\Text\n        body:\n            type: BackBee\\ClassContent\\Article\\Body\n    parameters:\n        accept: [BackBee\\ClassContent\\Text\\Paragraph]\n\n\n\nAs you can see, we have added a \nparameter\n to the article title configuration. Each parameter has a type and a value.\n\n\n\n\naccept\n:  \"lite\" is a configuration tree key in ``/repository/Config/rteconfig.yml, we will talk about aloha configuration later\n\n\neditable\n: this is explicit, we are now allowed to edit the title\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe \nPlugins\n mode\n\n\nIn BackBee, \nBundles\n are mostly considered \"plugins\". All the available bundles are displayed in this view.\nNotice that \nBackBee Standard edition\n comes with a DemoBundle, to help you build your own bundles.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, \nDemoBundle\n provides a \nClassContent\n called \nblock demo\n that you will find inside \nDemo\n category in \nBoxes\n panel. This bundle also provide a sample on how to make bundle manageable from the toolbar.\n\n\nIt is the \nblock demo\n from \nDemo\n category in \"Boxes\" panel.\n\n\nWe will learn more about bundles in the next days.\n\n\nArticle model improvements\n\n\nComplete our Article model\n\n\nThis is the configuration we will use for our Article model:\n\n\narticle:\n    properties:\n        name: Article\n        description: \nAn article contains title, abstract, main image and a customizable body\n\n        category: [article]\n    elements:\n        title:\n            type: BackBuilder\\ClassContent\\Element\\text\n            label: Title\n            # default value\n            default:\n                value: Your title here...\n            # set the max of content you can set\n            # an article has only one title\n            maxentry: 1\n\n        abstract:\n            type: BackBee\\ClassContent\\Text\\Paragraph\n            label: Abstract\n            default:\n                value: Your abstract here...\n            maxentry: 1\n        body:\n            type: BackBee\\ClassContent\\Article\\Body\n        image:\n            type: BackBee\\ClassContent\\Media\\Image\n\n\n\n\n\nThe complete configuration of contents we have defined in \nDay 3\n are stored in the \napplication github repository\n.\n\n\nBonus: manage your urls\n\n\nBackBee has a lot of features and today we will speak about urls. This is a very common need, that is, to have a total control on the urls generated by pages, mainly for search engine optimization (SEO).\n\n\nUrls are managed by Content and by configuration.\n\n\nAdd a new file in \nrepository/Config/\n folder and name it \nrewriting.yml\n.\n\n\nscheme:\n  _content_:\n    article: $ancestor[1]/$title\n\n\n\n\nNow make an update on your article (update the status of your article for instance),\nthen \"Save\" your modifications and BackBee will ask you to reload the browser page.\n\n\nAnd the url will be updated: \nnotice you need to update each existing article in order to apply the new url pattern\n.\n\n\nFinal thoughts\n\n\nWell, time is over!\n\n\nWe have seen a lot of features today, and we are now skilled enough to create any simple website you want.\nWe are able to integrate layouts and templates, to configure contents related to business and make them dynamic and editable by users.\n\n\nThe next days, we will go further on the BackBee discovery from bundle creation to events listeners and give you keys to finish your own BlogBee application!",

You can change the status of a page: if set to offline, non logged users can't access it. You can also schedule it to publish and archive it.  Also, if you click on the \"Sitemap\" link you access the page tree we have introduced on  Day 3 , and can easily reorganize page order and hierarchy.  For example, let's create a page.\nClick on \"New page\" and fill the form with \"article\" as title and \"Article\" as Template.  You can either do this by creating it right-clicking on Home page or using the Tools drop-down menu. \nThen, click on Save button and take a look at the \"Sitemap widget\".   The article page is offline, has a red hatched logo, an online page (like the  root  Home page) is white. You can manage your pages through the widget and/or in the  Page  panel.  the  Boxes  panel  You will probably only use this panel when you build your website.\nDouble-click on \"article\" in the \"Sitemap widget\" to access the new page created. Then switch to the  Boxes  panel:   And you retrieve the blocks created in the  repository\\ClassContent\\article.yml  file.  For example, click on the \"Upload picture\":   In the  breadcrumb , you can see  ContentSet   article   Media image .\nIf you take a look at your yaml file, you can see that an image has an image element, which is a  BackBee\\ClassContent\\Media\\image  class: good.  You can see also that Boxes are organized by  category . If you click on  Article  category you will find all the contents we created on  Day 4  with the category \"Article\": this is how BackBee orders and allows content to be used.  Each content must have a category, but sometimes you may need to deactivate a content because the final user shouldn't manipulate it.  You can use the \"!\" operator to filter contents, for instance we don't want the final user to add other article bodies to an article.  # /repository/ClassContent/Article/Body.yml\nbody:\n  extends: \\BackBee\\ClassContent\\ContentSet\n  properties:\n    category: [!Article]  And now,  body  is not part of available contents.  the  Content  panel  This is the most used panel of BackBee, able to manipulable all editable blocks. You may wonder how to make a block editable. Usually, this is a problem solved by Yaml configuration of the block.  Let's assume you want to let users edit the title of an article:  article:\n    properties:\n        name: Article\n        description: \"An article contains title, abstract, main image and a customizable body\"\n        category: [article]\n    elements:\n        title:\n            type: BackBee\\ClassContent\\Element\\Text\n        body:\n            type: BackBee\\ClassContent\\Article\\Body\n    parameters:\n        accept: [BackBee\\ClassContent\\Text\\Paragraph]  As you can see, we have added a  parameter  to the article title configuration.

Also, all commands of Bundles are autoloaded by the BackBee console.\n\n\nFor instance, the official \nDebugBundle\n shares a list of useful commands to help you develop\nyour website.\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\nLet's take a look at the architecture of our \"QuoteBundle\":\n\n\nQuoteBundle\n    |_ ClassContent/\n        |_ Quote.yml\n    |_ Config/\n        |_ config.yml\n    |_ Resources/\n        |_ css/\n            |_ quote.css\n    |_ Templates/\n        |_ scripts/\n            |_ Quote.twig\n    |_ Quote.php\n\n\n\n\nThere is no best practices for now but some conventions:\n\n all Commands classes MUST BE in the \nCommand\n folder in order to be autoloaded \"out of box\";\n\n \nConfig\n folder, \nconfig.yml\n and the entry point (here, \nQuote.php\n) are required;\n* all Class Contents MUST BE in the \nClassContent\n folder in order to be autoloaded \"out of box\";\n\n\nIf you need more informations on Bundle architecture, checks the \nofficial docs\n.\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nEach bundle need a configuration file, that contains configuration of Bundle loaded by BackBee. Look at this configuration reference file:\n\n\nbundle:\n    name: Foo bundle\n    description: A description of the bundle, displayed in extensions menu\n    author: John Doe \njohn.doe@backbee.com\n\n    version: 1\n    enable: true\n\n\n\n\nIf you want more information, each property is documented in \nofficial docs\n.\n\n\nEntryPoint and Recipes\n\n\nThe entry point of bundle is a simple POPO (Plain Old PHP Object) that MUST extends \nBackBee\\Bundle\\AbstractBundle\n class.\n\n\n?php\nnamespace BackBee\\Bundle\\FooBundle;\n/*\n * Copyright (c) 2011-2015 Lp digital system\n *\n * This file is part of BackBee.\n *\n * BackBee is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n * it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n * the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n * (at your option) any later version.\n *\n * BackBee is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n * but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Bundles are loaded with the application and can share class contents,\ncommands, listeners, services, templates... everything you can imagine.  When BackBee application is started, it loop into all the activated Bundles and register the configuration\nof each bundle and services if the Bundle share services. Also, all commands of Bundles are autoloaded by the BackBee console.  For instance, the official  DebugBundle  shares a list of useful commands to help you develop\nyour website.  Architecture  Let's take a look at the architecture of our \"QuoteBundle\":  QuoteBundle\n    |_ ClassContent/\n        |_ Quote.yml\n    |_ Config/\n        |_ config.yml\n    |_ Resources/\n        |_ css/\n            |_ quote.css\n    |_ Templates/\n        |_ scripts/\n            |_ Quote.twig\n    |_ Quote.php  There is no best practices for now but some conventions:  all Commands classes MUST BE in the  Command  folder in order to be autoloaded \"out of box\";   Config  folder,  config.yml  and the entry point (here,  Quote.php ) are required;\n* all Class Contents MUST BE in the  ClassContent  folder in order to be autoloaded \"out of box\";  If you need more informations on Bundle architecture, checks the  official docs .  Configuration  Each bundle need a configuration file, that contains configuration of Bundle loaded by BackBee. Look at this configuration reference file:  bundle:\n    name: Foo bundle\n    description: A description of the bundle, displayed in extensions menu\n    author: John Doe  john.doe@backbee.com \n    version: 1\n    enable: true  If you want more information, each property is documented in  official docs .  EntryPoint and Recipes  The entry point of bundle is a simple POPO (Plain Old PHP Object) that MUST extends  BackBee\\Bundle\\AbstractBundle  class.  ?php\nnamespace BackBee\\Bundle\\FooBundle;\n/*\n * Copyright (c) 2011-2015 Lp digital system\n *\n * This file is part of BackBee.\n *\n * BackBee is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n * it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n * the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n * (at your option) any later version.\n *\n * BackBee is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n * but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
